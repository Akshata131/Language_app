Technology for Language Application

A.	Optical Character Recognition

OCR (optical character recognition) is the use of technology to distinguish printed or handwritten text characters inside digital images of physical documents, such as a scanned paper document. The basic process of OCR involves examining the text of a document and translating the characters into code that can be used for data processing. OCR is sometimes also referred to as text recognition.
OCR systems are made up of a combination of hardware and software that is used to convert physical documents into machine-readable text. Hardware, such as an optical scanner or specialized circuit board is used to copy or read text while software typically handles the advanced processing. Software can also take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) to implement more advanced methods of intelligent character recognition (ICR), like identifying languages or styles of handwriting.

B.	Translate

Unless you have been hiding under a rock, you have probably used  Translate on many occasions in your life. Whenever you try to translate a word or a sentence from a certain language to another, it is the Translate API which brings you the desired results in the background. Though you can translate anything by simply going to the Translate web page, you can also integrate Translate API into your web applications or desktop programs. The best thing about the API is that it is extremely easy to set up and use.You can actually do a lot of things with the help of the Translate API ranging from detecting languages to simple text translation, setting source and destination languages, and translating entire lists of text phrases. In this system, you will see how to work with the Translate API in the Python programming language.

C.	Analysis

Sentiment.polarity

It is the expression that determines the sentimental aspect of an opinion. In textual data, the result of sentiment analysis can be determined for each entity in the sentence, document or sentence. The sentiment polarity can be determined as positive, negative and neutral.
TextBlob returns polarity and subjectivity of a sentence. Polarity lies between [-1,1], -1 defines a negative sentiment and 1 defines a positive sentiment. Negation words reverse the polarity. TextBlob has semantic labels that help with fine-grained analysis.
