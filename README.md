# Language_app

Language allows us to share our ideas, thoughts, and feelings with others. It is the way by which people communicate with one another, build relationships, and create a sense of community. But not always our mother tongue will be used in other countries, other domains so we need to know what the images wants to say, what person is saying in another language with the help of translation  and is it said in a bad way or good way with analysis.


#Technology for Language Application

A.	Optical Character Recognition

OCR (optical character recognition) is the use of technology to distinguish printed or handwritten text characters inside digital images of physical documents, such as a scanned paper document. The basic process of OCR involves examining the text of a document and translating the characters into code that can be used for data processing. OCR is sometimes also referred to as text recognition.

B.	Translate

Unless you have been hiding under a rock, you have probably used  Translate on many occasions in your life. Whenever you try to translate a word or a sentence from a certain language to another, it is the Translate API which brings you the desired results in the background. Though you can translate anything by simply going to the Translate web page, you can also integrate Translate API into your web applications or desktop programs. The best thing about the API is that it is extremely easy to set up and use.

C.	Analysis

Sentiment.polarity

It is the expression that determines the sentimental aspect of an opinion. In textual data, the result of sentiment analysis can be determined for each entity in the sentence, document or sentence. The sentiment polarity can be determined as positive, negative and neutral.TextBlob returns polarity and subjectivity of a sentence. Polarity lies between [-1,1], -1 defines a negative sentiment and 1 defines a positive sentiment. Negation words reverse the polarity. TextBlob has semantic labels that help with fine-grained analysis.
